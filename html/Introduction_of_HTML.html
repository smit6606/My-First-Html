    <h2>Introduction to HTML</h2>

    <p><b>What is HTML?</b></p>
    <p>
      HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create
      and structure webpages. It allows us to define elements like headings,
      paragraphs, links, and images.
    </p>

    <p><b>What is DOCTYPE?</b></p>
    <p>
      The <b>DOCTYPE</b> declaration tells the browser which version of HTML the
      page is using. It is used to declare an HTML5 document, ensuring that the
      browser renders the page correctly.
    </p>

    <p><b>What is html?</b></p>
    <p>
      The <b>html</b> tag is the root element of an HTML document. It contains
      all other elements and defines the overall structure of the webpage.
    </p>

    <p><b>What is head?</b></p>
    <p>
      The <b>head</b> tag contains metadata about the document, such as its
      title and links to stylesheets or scripts. This information is not
      displayed directly on the webpage but is essential for proper rendering
      and functionality.
    </p>

    <p><b>What is title?</b></p>
    <p>
      The <b>title</b> tag defines the document's title, which is shown in a
      browser's title bar or a page's tab. It helps users identify the page and
      is also used by search engines to understand the page's content.
    </p>

    <p><b>What is body?</b></p>
    <p>
      The <b>body</b> tag represents the content of an HTML document. It
      contains all the visible elements like text, images, and links.
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
